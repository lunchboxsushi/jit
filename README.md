## ü§ñ AI Enhancement

### Custom Templates
Create custom AI prompt templates in `~/.jit/templates/prompts/`:

**Example Epic Template:**
```markdown
You are helping create a well-structured Jira Epic for a software development team.

Title: {{TITLE}}
Raw Content: {{RAW_CONTENT}}

Please enhance this epic with:
1. Clear problem statement
2. Success criteria
3. High-level approach
4. Dependencies and risks: {{What are the main technical risks for this epic?}}
5. Estimated timeline

Keep the tone professional but concise.
```

### AI Expressions
Use `{{expression}}` for dynamic AI-generated content:
- `{{What are the main risks for this change?}}`
- `{{List potential dependencies for this feature}}`
- `{{Suggest 3 acceptance criteria for this task}}`

## üîÑ Typical Workflows

jit subtask               # Create subtask under task
jit comment "Started implementation"
```

### Continuing Existing Work
```bash
# Resume work on existing tickets
jit track PROJ-1234      # Track epic and children
jit focus "login"        # Switch to login-related task
jit subtask              # Add new subtask
jit open                 # Review in browser
```

### Quick Operations
```bash
# Fast ticket operations
jit link -s              # Copy ticket number
